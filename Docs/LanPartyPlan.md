##Chelmsford Makerspace LANParty Plan

One of the ideas I have in mind are LANParty's which could take place monthly to raise funding and let people take a break from their projects/school/whatever and relax.
The plan illustrated below is basically what I think we should use as guidelines to running the Lan Party's.

###The Hardware
- We will bring one PC which will serve as the master server hosting a variety of games and other systems.
- Attendees are expected to bring their own equipment along, we can only supply a maximum of 2 plug sockets per person, so please don't bring second monitors or really powerful stuff.
- Networking can be provided overwireless or traditional ethernet.
- Tables and Chairs will be provided as CMS norm.
- No PCs will be handed out and responsibiliy lies with you to keep your PC in good health.
- Please scan your PC for viruses because the last thing a LAN Party needs is Digital STDs.

###The Software
- The Server will be equipped with
 - A [Murmer(Mumble)](http://mumble.sourceforge.net/) server.
 - A few copies of SRCDS (Source Dedicated Server). Each installed with at least:
  - CS:S
  - CS:GO
  - TF2
  - CS
  - HL2:DM
  - GMOD
  - Killing Floor
  - L4D2
 - A web server providing support and downloads to common software.
 - SourceTV being recorded to demos.
- Attendees are expected to bring
 - A copy of their operating system of choice.
 - A copy of Steam, non-windows users might will want to also bring wine copies just in case.
 - A copy of the games they wish to play, updated and working. We will allow access to the internet to authenticate with steam but will NOT allow downloading/updating of games   over a fair usage amount (e.g. 10mb updates are fine, but 100mb are not).
 - A copy of Mumble if they wish to use voice to talk to their teammates/across the room without shouting.
 - A copy of a browser should the user wish to access the net.

### Other Stuff
- The likely hood is that food will be bought prior or during the cource of the event and we won't charge you to have your share, but please be conciderate to other people before walking off with 2L of Coke.
- We still follow the rules of CMS.
- Be respectful to other people.
- Costing can vary but a guideline price would be about Â£4 to cover cost of increased electricty usage and Food.
- Due to arrangements in the Hut we cannot allow sleeping between games, it's just not practical.

### How it plays out.
- Setup should be around 45 minutes. This includes
 - Getting tables out, power ready.
 - Feeding each seat a ethernet and kettle leads.
 - Setting up Battlestations.
 - Setting up drinks and food.
 - Setting up Server.
 - Getting passwords to Wifi to everyone.
 - Welcome and rule explaining.
 - Troubleshooting problems.
 - Steam/Playernames are taken down to reference to actual player.
- After that we announce the games will start and votes are placed via the webserver to the first game.
- The server admin takes around 3-4 minutes to setup the server while people start the games (the servers will already be running, but team names and stuff will need doing).
- The games will start, teams are picked and noted down via web interface.
- Anybody on the wrong team will be moved to the right teams.
- At the end of each round, scores are noted down and at the end of a set amount of maps/rounds, a new game is voted for.
- Secondary practise servers will be running in the background for non-competers.

### Point Scoring
Points are awarded for each player based on:
- On the winning team: 1pt
- MVP/Top3 Player: 1pt (Not awarded if either below are awarded)
- Top of Team: 2pt
- Top of Server: 1pt
At the end of the event, points are tallyed for each player. 1st, 2nd and 3rd positions are awarded *something*.
Hopefully later on a montage of the LAN party is edited together with demo files of good moments along with recordings.
